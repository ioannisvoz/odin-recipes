  <p>The Vikings had a meat diet based on pig meat. Sheep meat, fish and game also played a large role. The seal in particular bears mention, which left meat, blood and fat. Clams and other shellfish occasionally made for a variation in diet.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>1 - 1.5 litres of water</li>
    <li>500g meat (pig, ox, sheep, chicken or fish)</li>

    <li>salt</li>
  </ul>
